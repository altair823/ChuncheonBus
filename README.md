[![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/altair823/ChuncheonBus)]()

A web scraper for chuncheon bus timetable.

## Features
 - Inform the departure time of bus in chuncheon

## What is lacking
 - The only site that scraper correctly scraping is [chuncheon bus timetable site](http://www.chuncheon-pti.kr/index.php?mp=p2_4_1)

This highly not compatible and unstable scraper is only scraping the chuncheon bus timetable site. 
But the elementary library files doing scraping or string handling, etc, in 'lib' package are applicable in such many my personal python projects.
